> -   Clear mention of the **process** used to produce statistics

> -   *To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on the* ***methods and procedures*** *for the collection*, ***processing***, *storage and presentation of statistical data*.

## Usual practice: Theory *vs* reality

::: notes
Any Reproducible analytical pipeline has a clear set of steps that we do once in succession to create a final report.

:::

## Usual practice: In the end

<p class="aligncenter">

</p>

::: notes
In reality though, our ideal analytical pipeline can quickly become a complicated tangle of multiple file and data versions, programs, emails and final reports.
:::

## What are the issues?

-   Lots of files <img src="images/TraditionalMess.png" width="20%" height="auto" align="right"/>
-   Cut and paste is not a reliable, reproducible approach! <img src="images/ExcelUK.png" width="20%" height="auto" align="right"/>
-   Mistakes hard to track
-   Each operator has his/her own approach
-   Several versions of code may coexist <img src="images/FinalFinalVersion.png" width="20%" height="auto" align="right"/>
-   The steps aren't recorded
-   Testing is hard
-   Reproducibility is not granted
-   Quality is controlled only at the end

::: notes
There are some key issues with this type of analytical pipeline:

-   Each step is manual and has to be completed in turn
-   It is difficult to teach someone else to replicate the process
-   Because each step is manual mistakes can be made
-   The different steps involved are often not recorded nor is how they can change
-   The pipeline combines multiple different programs
-   There isn't a way of keeping track of changes to files and who made them

## What is a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)?

<a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction"> <img src="images/ReusablePipeline.png" alt="Source: The Turing Way" width="65%" height="auto" align="right"/> </a>

<br><br>

-   It is a process
-   It is easily repeatable
-   It is easily extendable
-   It is automated
-   It minimises mistakes
-   It is fast
-   It builds trust


::: notes
This is where a reproducible analytical pipeline can help. It is:

-   Easy for you to reproduce
-   Easy for your future-self or others to reproduce
-   It can easily be adapted and improved (towards replication)
-   It is automated
-   Because it is automated, it minimizes mistakes introduced by individual error
-   It is fast to run (slow to build)
-   It is transparent and this helps building trust

## What does a RAP look like?

It is a **simple** process:

<img src="images/RAP-Pipeline1.png" width="60%" height="auto" align="right"/> <br>

-   linking **inputs** (data)
-   to **outputs** (publication)

## What does a RAP look like?

This process can be **decomposed**:

<img src="images/RAP-Pipeline3.png" width="60%" height="auto" align="right"/>

<br>

-   Succession of tasks
-   Direct linkage of actions


## What does a RAP look like?

This process can be **decomposed**:

<img src="images/RAP-Pipeline4.png" width="60%" height="auto" align="right"/>

<br>

-   Each task is coded
-   $\hookrightarrow$ No manual actions
-   Each task uses inputs
-   Each task produces outputs
-   $\hookrightarrow$ Easy to test tasks individually
-   $\hookrightarrow$ Each output is identified

## What does a RAP look like?

This process is **documented**:

<img src="images/RAP-Pipeline5.png" width="55%" height="auto" align="right"/>

<br>

-   Each code has versions
-   Versions are annotated
-   $\hookrightarrow$ Easy to follow tasks development
-   $\hookrightarrow$ Easy to track mistakes

## What does a RAP look like?

This process is  **easy to save**:

<img src="images/RAP-Pipeline6.png" width="60%" height="auto" align="right"/>

<br>

-   Each code is securely saved
-   Each version can be revereted
-   $\hookrightarrow$ Easy to undo/revert to past version
-   $\hookrightarrow$ Easy to test

## What are the benefits?

<a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction"> <img src="images/ReusablePipeline.png" alt="Source: The Turing Way" width="65%" height="auto" align="right"/> </a>

Analysis within an RAP are: <br>

-   Easy to use
-   Easy to find information
-   Easy for others to use
-   Easy to revise and adapt
-   Easy to reuse
-   Automated and fast
-   Open and promoting trust



::: notes
A reproducible analytical pipeline is:

-   Easy to use, often with a single click of a button
-   It can easily be adapted by you and others
-   All steps for building and maintaining the pipeline are recorded
-   It is automated, replicating hours or days of work in seconds
-   Because everything is documented and open, people can see how we have created our outputs and replicate them for themselves - building trust
:::

## What do we need?

-   A good knowledge of the process
-   A good organisation:

    -   of files
    -   of code
    -   of documentation

-   An open source software  <a href="https://rstudio.com/"> <img src="images/logos/RStudio_logo.png" width="25%" height="auto" align="right"/> </a>

-   A versioning system <a href="https://git-scm.com/"> <img src="images/logos/git_logo.jpg" width="25%" height="auto" align="right"/> </a>\

-   **Time to learn**

::: notes
The beauty of a reproducible analytical pipeline is that they don't need much, just open-source tools and version control. That's what make them so easy for others to use and adapt.

They do take time to build though, we need to carefully map out each of steps required from downloading the data to generating a report.

We need to be ready to devote a considerable amount of time to learn the necessary skills.

## RAP in practice 

- Implemented in some NSOs (Vanuatu) <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction"> <img src="images/ReusablePipeline.png" alt="Source: The Turing Way" width="30%" height="auto" align="right"/> </a>
- Can be done easily with R/Rstudio
- Can also be done with Python/Jupyter notebooks, Quarto (both R, Python, Julia, others...)
- Large community to help
