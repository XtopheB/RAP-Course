## Welcome 

This is an interactive tutorial that should help you verify that you and your computer are ready to use the materials developed for this course using R and RStudio.^[This document uses materials developed by *Garrick Aden-Buie, Barret Schloerke & JJ Allaire* , the creators of the [learner](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package]  

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this tutorial you should be able to:  

* Install R on your computer
* Install the RStudio IDE
* Install the `tidyverse` R package
* Run a few lines of R code

You can skip this tutorial if you've already done these things and are familiar with R and RStudio environments, but it may be safer to check!

### Is this tutorial for you?

Do you need to work through the tutorial? Take the quiz below to find out.

```{r quiz1, echo = FALSE}
question("Check all that is TRUE:",
  answer("R is NOT installed on my computer", message = "* Install R"),
  answer("RStudio is NOT installed on my computer", message = "* Install RStudio IDE"),
  answer("The **tidyverse** package is not installed on my computer", message = "* Install Packages"),
  answer("I've done them all.", correct = TRUE, message = "You can skip this tutorial! (or still click on *Continue* if you want!)"),
  type = "multiple",
  incorrect = "Don't worry, this tutorial is here to help!  To get set up follow the tutorial and follow (at least):"
)
```

>*We highly recommend that you follow the order of the items proposed in this tutorial*!

## Install R
*R* is the core piece of software that we need and we certainly wouldn't be able to do anything without a proper and recent version installed on our computers. 

> If your computer was a plane, we may think of R as the engine

### How to install R
The best way is to follow the instructions in this video (*1 min 30s*)

### Test your knowledge

```{r quiz2, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - About R",
  question("Is R free to download and use?",
    answer("Yes!", correct = TRUE, message = "R is free _and_ open source, which means that anyone can read, use, and copy the source code of the R language."),
    answer("No.",  message = "R is indeed free _AND_ open source, which means that anyone can read, use, and copy the source code of the R language.")
  ),
  question("Where do you download R?",
    answer("www.rstudio.com/download"),
    answer("[cloud.r-project.org](http://cloud.r-project.org)", correct = TRUE, message = "You can also download R from [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org)"),
    answer("www.r-project.org", message = "Good try, but not exactly. www.r-project.org doesn't provide a download link, but it does provide a link to one the websites above."),
    answer("www.r.com"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How often should you update R?",
    answer("Everytime you use it", message = "This will be too often unless you use R very rarely!"),
    answer("About once a year", correct = TRUE, "A new version of R is released about once a year. Update sooner if you encounter a bug that you cannot explain."),
    answer("Never", message = "A new version of R is released about once a year. I'll assume that you are using the newest version of R, which will be the fastest version with the fewest unexpected behaviors." ),
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Install RStudio
RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It means that RStudio helps you write and work with R in a very intuitive and simple way.  

> If your computer was a plane, we may think of RStudio as the cockpit  

### How to install RStudio

 RStudio makes editing, programming and visualizing in R much easier and we highly recommend that you install it and use it.  
 
 For that, follow the instructions in this video (*50 sec*)

![](https://vimeo.com/203516968)

### Test your knowledge

```{r quiz3, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Install RStudio",
  question("What is the RStudio IDE?",
    answer("An application that makes it easier to use R.", correct = TRUE, message = "RStudio organizes your workspace and makes it easier to write, use, debug, and save R code. We highly recommend it and we will rely on the RStudio IDE in this course."),
    answer("An application that let's you use R without writing any code", message = "And thank goodness! Code provides a reproducible record of your work, which is essential for data science."),
    answer("A spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel.", message = "No. Although we can visualise data in RStudio almost as in Microsoft Excel, RStudio is much more than that!"),
    answer("Another name for R", message = "No. R and RStudio are two separate things: R is the real data and code processing *engine* while RStudio is the environment that facilitate your life to provide instrcutions, like a *cokpit*. "),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Is the RStudio IDE free to download and use?",
    answer("Yes!", correct = TRUE, message = "Like R, RStudio is free and open-source. There do exist professional versions of RStudio with enhanced features, but we will not rely on those features."),
    answer("No.", message = "Like R, RStudio is free and open-source. There do exist professional versions of RStudio with enhanced features, but we will not rely on those features.")
  ),
  question("Where do you download RStudio?",
    answer("www.rstudio.com/download", correct = TRUE, message = "For these tutorials, download and install the RStudio Desktop Open Source License."),
    answer("[cloud.r-project.org](http://cloud.r-project.org)", message = "This is where you download R, not RStudio."),
    answer("www.r-project.org"),
    answer("[cran.rstudio.org](http://cran.rstudio.org)"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Do you need to install R if you already have RStudio?",
    answer("Yes.", correct = TRUE, message = " Yes. RStudio needs the R *engine* to work"),
    answer("No.", message = "R does not come with RStudio; you need to install R separately. It is best to start by installing R and then RStudio.")
  )
)
```

## Install Packages
The R community is very active and has created many packages, each solving a different problem. There are hundreds of packages created each month and we should take advantages of this packages to avoid reinventing the wheel. 

> If your computer was a plane, we may think of the packages as all the components needed to fly (gyroscope, lights, GPS, ... )   

### How to install R packages
The best way is to follow the instructions in this video (*1 min 32s*)

### Test your knowledge

```{r names, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Working with Packages",
  question("What command do you use to install packages?",
    answer("`library()`", message = "We will see what `library()` does later."),
    answer("`install.packages()`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`install_packages()`"),
    answer("There is no command. You must visit [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org) and download packages manually.", message = "R makes it easy to download packages. You connect to the internet and then run one of the commands above."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How often do you need to install a package on your computer?",
    answer("Every time you restart R"),
    answer("Every time you restart your computer"),
    answer("Only once. Afterwards, R can find it on your hard drive as needed.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Never, as long as you are connected to the internet.", message = "This could be true if you are using R over a cloud service. However, if you are using R locally on your own computer, you will need to install each package that you use on your computer."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("What is the tidyverse?",
    answer("A collection of packages that work well together and provide tools for common data science tasks.", correct = TRUE, message = 'You can install all of the tidyverse packages at once with `install.packages("tidyverse")`.'),
    answer("A word processing program for R"),
    answer("A code style that reads like poetry"),
    answer("An alternate universe where everyone is an R programmer."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```


## Test your R  skills


### Prerequisites
To practice these skills, we will use the `flights` data set from the nycflights13 package. This data frame comes from the US [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Homepage.asp){target="_blank"} and contains all `r format(nrow(nycflights13::flights), big.mark = ",")` flights that departed from New York City in 2013. The variables are documented in [the description file on the CRAN](https://rdrr.io/cran/nycflights13/man/flights.html){target="_blank"} but you can check also directly within R, as we will see. 

If you are ready to begin, click on!

###  The dataset
Before playing with some functions in the tidyverse package, let's have a look at the variables available in the `flights` data set using some base R commands 

```{r data, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
names(flights)
```

Now, can you display the first lines of the data set (maybe using using the  `head()` function) ?


```{r filter2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

```{r filter2-solution}
head(flights, n=5)
```

> If that wasn't easy for you, you may face some difficulties in this course!


### Playing with `tidyverse` (and `filter()`)

`filter()` lets you use a logical test to extract specific rows from a data frame. To use `filter()`, pass it the data frame followed by one or more logical tests. `filter()` will return every row that passes each logical test.

So for example, we can use `filter()` to select every flight in flights that departed on January 1st. Click `Run Code` to give it a try:

```{r filter1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(month == 1, 
         day == 1)
```


### Test Your Knowledge

***What will the following code return?** 
  
```{r, eval= FALSE}
flights %>%
  filter( month == 11 | month == 12)
```


```{r logicals, echo = FALSE}
question("",
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _or_ December", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _and_ December",
                message = "Technically a flight could not have departed in November _and_ December unless it departed twice."),
         answer("Every flight _except for_ those that departed in November or December",
                message = "No, there is no negative statement in this code."),
         answer("An error. This is an incorrect way to combine tests.",
                message = "No, this code is perfectly fine. It use the `|` operator meaning *or*. "),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Common mistakes

In R, the order of operations doesn't work like English. You **can't** write `filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)`, even though you might say  "finds all flights that departed in November *or* December". Be sure to write out a *complete* test on each side of a boolean operator.

Here are four more tips to help you use logical tests and Boolean operators in R:

###

1. A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. This will select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`. We could use it to rewrite the code in the question above:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
nov_dec <-  flights %>%
      filter(month %in% c(11, 12))
    ```

### Exercise 

Use the code chunks below to find all flights that:

1. Had an arrival *delay* of two or more hours (that's 120 minutes!)

    ```{r filterex1, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    
    ```{r filterex1-solution}
    flights %>% 
      filter(arr_delay >= 120) # arr_delay is in minutes
    ```

1. Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)

    ```{r filterex2, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    
    ```{r filterex2-solution}
    flights %>%
      filter(dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
    ```

    

1. Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)


    ```{r filterex3, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    
    ```{r filterex3-solution}
    filter(flights, carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))
    ```

    <div id="filterex3-hint">
    **Hint:** The `carrier` variable lists the airline that operated each flight. This is another good case for the `%in%` operator.
    </div>
