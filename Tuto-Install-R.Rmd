## Welcome 

This is an interactive tutorial that should help you verify that you and  your computer are ready to use the materials developed for this course.^[This document uses materials developed by *Garrick Aden-Buie, Barret Schloerke & JJ Allaire* , the creators of the [learner](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package]  

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this tutorial you should be able to:  

* Install R on your computer
* Install the RStudio IDE
* Install the `tidyverse` R package

You can skip this tutorial if you've already done these things, by it may be safer to check (click `continue`).

### Is this tutorial for you?

Do you need to work through the tutorial? Take the quiz below to find out.


```{r quiz1, echo = FALSE}
question("Check all that is TRUE:",
  answer("R is NOT installed on my computer", message = "* Install R"),
  answer("RStudio is NOT installed on my computer", message = "* Install RStudio IDE"),
  answer("The **tidyverse** package is not installed on my computer", message = "* Install Packages"),
  answer("I've done them all.", correct = TRUE, message = "You can skip this tutorial! (or still click on *Continue* if you want!)"),
  type = "multiple",
  incorrect = "Don't worry, this tutorial is here to help!  To get set up follow the tutorial and follow (at least):"
)
```

>*We highly recommend that you follow the order of the items proposed in this tutorial*!

## Install R
*R* is the core piece of software that we need and we certainly wouldn't be able to do anything without a proper and recent version installed on our computers. 

> If our computer was a plane, we may think of R as the engine

### How to install R
The best way is to follow the instructions in this video (*1 min 30s*)

### Test your knowledge

```{r quiz2, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - About R",
  question("Is R free to download and use?",
    answer("Yes!", correct = TRUE, message = "R is free _and_ open source, which means that anyone can read, use, and copy the source code of the R language."),
    answer("No.",  message = "R is indeed free _AND_ open source, which means that anyone can read, use, and copy the source code of the R language.")
  ),
  question("Where do you download R?",
    answer("www.rstudio.com/download"),
    answer("[cloud.r-project.org](http://cloud.r-project.org)", correct = TRUE, message = "You can also download R from [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org)"),
    answer("www.r-project.org", message = "Good try, but not exactly. www.r-project.org doesn't provide a download link, but it does provide a link to one the websites above."),
    answer("www.r.com"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How often should you update R?",
    answer("Everytime you use it", message = "This will be too often unless you use R very rarely!"),
    answer("About once a year", correct = TRUE, "A new version of R is released about once a year. Update sooner if you encounter a bug that you cannot explain."),
    answer("Never", message = "A new version of R is released about once a year. I'll assume that you are using the newest version of R, which will be the fastest version with the fewest unexpected behaviors." ),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Install RStudio
RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It means that RStudio helps you write and work with R in a very intuitive and simple way.  

> If our computer was a plane, we may think of RStudio as the cockpit  

### How to install RStudio

 RStudio makes editing, programming and visualizing in R much easier and we highly recommend that you install it and use it.  
 
 For that, follow the instructions in this video (*50 sec*)

### Test your knowledge

```{r quiz3, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Install RStudio",
  question("What is the RStudio IDE?",
    answer("An application that makes it easier to use R.", correct = TRUE, message = "RStudio organizes your workspace and makes it easier to write, use, debug, and save R code. We highly recommend it and we will rely on the RStudio IDE in this course."),
    answer("An application that let's you use R without writing any code", message = "And thank goodness! Code provides a reproducible record of your work, which is essential for data science."),
    answer("A spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel.", message = "No. Although we can visualise data in RStudio almost as in Microsoft Excel, RStudio is much more than that!"),
    answer("Another name for R", message = "No. R and RStudio are two separate things: R is the real data and code processing *engine* while RStudio is the environment that facilitate your life to provide instrcutions, like a *cokpit*. "),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Is the RStudio IDE free to download and use?",
    answer("Yes!", correct = TRUE, message = "Like R, RStudio is free and open-source. There do exist professional versions of RStudio with enhanced features, but we will not rely on those features."),
    answer("No.", message = "Like R, RStudio is free and open-source. There do exist professional versions of RStudio with enhanced features, but we will not rely on those features.")
  ),
  question("Where do you download RStudio?",
    answer("www.rstudio.com/download", correct = TRUE, message = "For these tutorials, download and install the RStudio Desktop Open Source License."),
    answer("[cloud.r-project.org](http://cloud.r-project.org)", message = "This is where you download R, not RStudio."),
    answer("www.r-project.org"),
    answer("[cran.rstudio.org](http://cran.rstudio.org)"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Do you need to install R if you already have RStudio?",
    answer("Yes.", correct = TRUE, message = " Yes. RStudio needs the R *engine* to work"),
    answer("No.", message = "R does not come with RStudio; you need to install R separately. It is best to start by installing R and then RStudio.")
  )
)
```

## Install Packages
The R community is very active and has created many packages, each solving a different problem. There are hundreds of packages created each month and we should take advantages of this packages to avoid reinventing the wheel. 

> If our computer was a plane, we may think of the packages as all the components needed to fly (gyroscope, lights, GPS, ... )   

### How to install R packages
The best way is to follow the instructions in this video (*1 min 32s*)

### Test your knowledge

```{r names, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Working with Packages",
  question("What command do you use to install packages?",
    answer("`library()`", message = "We will see what `library()` does later."),
    answer("`install.packages()`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`install_packages()`"),
    answer("There is no command. You must visit [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org) and download packages manually.", message = "R makes it easy to download packages. You connect to the internet and then run one of the commands above."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How often do you need to install a package on your computer?",
    answer("Every time you restart R"),
    answer("Every time you restart your computer"),
    answer("Only once. Afterwards, R can find it on your hard drive as needed.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Never, as long as you are connected to the internet.", message = "This could be true if you are using R over a cloud service. However, if you are using R locally on your own computer, you will need to install each package that you use on your computer."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("What is the tidyverse?",
    answer("A collection of packages that work well together and provide tools for common data science tasks.", correct = TRUE, message = 'You can install all of the tidyverse packages at once with `install.packages("tidyverse")`.'),
    answer("A word processing program for R"),
    answer("A code style that reads like poetry"),
    answer("An alternate universe where everyone is an R programmer."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
