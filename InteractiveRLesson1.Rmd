## Some examples in Naming conventions

This is an interactive tutorial that should help you verify your understanding of some problems in naming variables 

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this tutorial you should be able to:  

* Verify your naming practices
* Experiment some common mistakes in programming
* TBC



### Prerequisites
To practice these skills, we will use the `flights` data set from the nycflights13 package. This data frame comes from the US [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Homepage.asp){target="_blank"} and contains all `r format(nrow(nycflights13::flights), big.mark = ",")` flights that departed from New York City in 2013. The variables are documented in [the description file on the CRAN](https://rdrr.io/cran/nycflights13/man/flights.html){target="_blank"} but you can check also directly within R, as we will see. 

If you are ready to begin, click on!

###  The dataset
Before playing, let's upload our toy data set

```{r data, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
names(flights)


```

Now, can you display the first lines of the data set (maybe using using the  `head()` function) ?


```{r filter2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

```{r filter2-solution}
head(flights, n=5)
```

> If that wasn't easy for you, you may face some difficulties in this course!


### Playing with `tidyverse` (and `filter()`)

`filter()` lets you use a logical test to extract specific rows from a data frame. To use `filter()`, pass it the data frame followed by one or more logical tests. `filter()` will return every row that passes each logical test.

So for example, we can use `filter()` to select every flight in flights that departed on January 1st. Click `Run Code` to give it a try:

```{r filter1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(month == 1, 
         day == 1)
```


### Test Your Knowledge

***What will the following code return?** 
  
```{r, eval= FALSE}
flights %>%
  filter( month == 11 | month == 12)
```


```{r logicals, echo = FALSE}
question("",
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _or_ December", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _and_ December",
                message = "Technically a flight could not have departed in November _and_ December unless it departed twice."),
         answer("Every flight _except for_ those that departed in November or December",
                message = "No, there is no negative statement in this code."),
         answer("An error. This is an incorrect way to combine tests.",
                message = "No, this code is perfectly fine. It use the `|` operator meaning *or*. "),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Common mistakes

In R, the order of operations doesn't work like English. You **can't** write `filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)`, even though you might say  "finds all flights that departed in November *or* December". Be sure to write out a *complete* test on each side of a boolean operator.

Here are four more tips to help you use logical tests and Boolean operators in R:

###

1. A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. This will select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`. We could use it to rewrite the code in the question above:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
nov_dec <-  flights %>%
      filter(month %in% c(11, 12))
    ```

### Exercise 

Use the code chunks below to find all flights that:

1. Had an arrival *delay* of two or more hours (that's 120 minutes!)

    ```{r filterex1, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    
    ```{r filterex1-solution}
    flights %>% 
      filter(arr_delay >= 120) # arr_delay is in minutes
    ```

1. Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)

    ```{r filterex2, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    
    ```{r filterex2-solution}
    flights %>%
      filter(dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
    ```

    

1. Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)


    ```{r filterex3, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    
    ```{r filterex3-solution}
    filter(flights, carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))
    ```

    <div id="filterex3-hint">
    **Hint:** The `carrier` variable lists the airline that operated each flight. This is another good case for the `%in%` operator.
    </div>
